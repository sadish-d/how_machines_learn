This is a brief, interactive essay on a fundamental idea in machine learning (gradient descent) written in Julia and using data from the Ukrainian refugee crisis.

You can download the interactive essay as a [Pluto notebook](https://github.com/sadish-d/how_machines_learn/blob/main/how_machines_learn.jl) or, if you have the patience, try **[launching it online](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.12/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fsadish-d%252Fhow_machines_learn%252Fmain%252Fhow_machines_learn.jl)**.

Here is a preview of a machine learning the relationship between Ukraine's social connections with different regions in Poland and how many Ukrainian refugees per capita settled there.
